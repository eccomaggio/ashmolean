Both figures are mounted on plinths of oak veneered with brass, fire gilt, and with tortoiseshell, fitted with bronze scroll-feet and lion masks, also fire-gilt. (Some pieces of veneer are loose, broken, or missing especially below the lion heads on the back and side faces of both plinths.) There are circular paper labels below the plinths with black borders and 'J. FRANCIS & MARGARET MALLETT' printed, and with '27E' inscribed in ink, in the centre. Both plinths marked 'M 176/1' and 'M176/2' in black paint on the corner of the upper ormolu moulding of the plinth  where chamfered.

Described by Mallett as 'Finely modelled and highly finished. Beautiful brown patina. N. Italian. Attributed to Pietro Tacca.' The pair of figures are in fact cast from models almost certainly made by Algardi. Together with a figure of Christ bound to the column, they formed one of the most popular small sculptural groups (of silver as well as of bronze) in European art. The same model for Christ is employed with flagellators of a different design which may plausibly be attributed to Duquesnoy, who is indeed credited by Bellori with the invention of a group of this subject (including Christ). Jennifer Montagu has proposed, convincingly, that the more vigorous of the pairs of flagellators-that represented by the Ashmolean's bronzes-originated in models by Algardi. She dates these models to the second half of the 1630s. Of this particular pair of bronzes she writes: 'The casts appear to be reasonably old, although the Boulle-type bases are no doubt of more recent date' (J. Montagu, Alessandro Algardi (London and New Haven, Conn.,1985), i.19z ii. 315-22, no. 9; and for the Ashmolean bronzes 319, no. 9 C. 19). The bases resemble in both style and materials French work of the late seventeenth century of the kind revived in the second half of the eighteenth century, but they may be of modern manufacture; certainly all screw fittings appear to be modern.

Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. S.37 in his catalogues. Said in the large catalogue and the notebook catalogue to have been acquired from Amici in Rome in 1853; but in the preliminary catalogue of 1857 the date is given as 1851.

This bust of the Muse of Comedy was evidently acquired with that of Melpomene, the Muse of Tragedy (No. 20 [WA1899.CDEF.S36]), as a companion, this couple in turn forming a pair for the two copies of antique heads by Gott (Nos. 514, 515). Fortnum noted that it was 'Thalia. Copy from the antique statue in the Vatican'. The statue in question is a seated Muse in the Sala delle Muse in the Museo Pio-Clementino which was discovered, together with the Melpomene and other Muses, at the supposed Villa di Cassio at Tivoli in excavations commenced before 1773 by Domenico de' Angelis, and was obtained for the papal museum by the intervention of Giovanni-Battista Visconti in 1774 (W. Amelung and G. Lippold, Die Skulpturen des Vaticanischen Museums, III. i (Berlin, 1935-56), no. 503--erroneously 508 in plates; C. Pietrangeli, Scavi e scoperte di antichità sotto il Pontificato di Pio VI (Rome, 1958), 139-40). The copy is in some respects an improvement on the original, in which the leaves in the hair are not completely undercut but retain their bridges. Amici had worked in Canova's studio and was one of the leading sculptors in Rome in the decades following Canova's death. He completed the tomb of Pope Gregory XVI in St Peter's in 1854 and would have been busy with this huge work when Fortnum visited his studio. Such a bust is likely to have been produced under Amici's supervision rather than executed by him in person and was probably a stock item designed for sale to studio visitors rather than specially commissioned. An identical bust is in the Royal Palace in Madrid (numbered 427 in hollow behind chest), also paired with a Melpomene. Another was lot 246 in the sale of Durwards Hall, Kelvedon, Essex, Christie's, 10-11 July 1989.",,

Chaplet pins evident in the interior of the bronze (at faun's right shoulder). 'B/--88/[symbol reminiscent of EF]' is painted in white on the interior of the tortoise shell together with a recent label numbered '112'. The same is painted in the inside of the body of the tortoise with another label numbered '112' below.

Lent by D.E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888 and given later in the same year. B. 1088 in his catalogues. Presumably acquired after 1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which it is not included, was compiled.

An inkpot would presumably have been placed in the shell

held in the faun's right hand. Divisions for pen and sand are

found in the body of the tortoise. Classed by Fortnum as 'Florentine?' and dated to 1580 in his notebook catalogue.Having discovered that it was in the manner of Bartolommeo Ammanati (1511-92), he corrected the date ot 1560, and toyed with the idea that it might be by Ammanati, but, surely rightly, confined himself to observing that there is an obvious debt to the latter's eight split-legged fauns, some with similar grins and brushed-back hair, placed in 1575 around the rim of the Fountain of Neptune in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence--works designed probably in 1560 when Ammanati was competing for the commission. Bode, oddly, seems to have ignored this connection and published the inkstand as a Venetian work of around 1575 (Italian Bronze Statuettes of the Renaissance (London, 1907-12), i. 74, fig. 90). Pope-Hennessy on the other hand regarded it as 'likely that the inkstand is an autograph small bronze by Ammanati' (Italian Bronze Statuettes (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1961), no.113). J. Draper in his 1980 revised edition of Bode has suggested 'North Italian late Sixteenth Century'.

The surface of the bronze is very dull and the linear pattern of the tortoise shell and skin in particular is blunt and vague. This is also true of the version in the Metropolitan Museum, New York (10.173--in reserve), but less true of that in the Rijksmuseum (J. Leeuwenberg, Beeldhouwkunst in het Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam, 1973), 379, no. 638). (Neither of these versions retains the body of the tortoise as a base.) It is surely very unlikely that any of these three bronzes are autograph works by Ammanati. The casting technique (which may not be lost-wax) does not resemble that of any sixteenth-century bronze inkstand I have inspected. It is possible that they were made in the last century when at least one sculptor was an accomplished mimic of Ammanati's style--this was Francesco Pozzi (1779-1844), who, in 1831, executed the right-hand satyr of the south-east face of the fountain--the 'satyr to left of the marine goddess who looks towards the Marzocco' (A. Lensi, Il Palazzo Vecchio (Milan, 1929), 315, citing F. Moisè, Illustrazione storico-artistica del Palazzo de'Priori, oggi Palazzo Vecchio (Florence, 1843), 169 n.)--as a replacement for one of Ammanati's. This large bronze is, however, a superior cast, the equal of its neighbours and far sharper than the inkstands. For a reduction of a part of Ammanati's fountain on a scale comparable with the inkstands see Christie's, New York, I November 1989, lot 53.",,

Bequeathed by the Rev. J. W. R. Brocklebank in 1926. No. 30 on Andrew Shirley's receipt of January 1927 ('A verde statuette, Victory, standing on marble sphere & plinth').

This is unusual among the bronzes in Brocklebank's collection in that it is a replica of an antique, but it is nevertheless not unrelated in taste to his other pieces, and in particular his versions of Gilbert's treatment of the same theme (Nos. 502, 503, 512). The firm of De Angelis was founded in 1840 and prospered in the last years of the last century and in the early years of this, specializing in reproductions of the most popular items in the Naples Museum. Larger works produced by them in the first decade of this century are signed 'S. de Angelis & Fils' (see the life-size Athlete at Cartwright Hall, Bradford, dated 1905 and the reduction of the Adorante sold at Sotheby's, London, 11 June 198z lot 239/2, dated 1907). By 1915 the firm had merged with that of Chiurazzi (which had been established in 1870 by J. Chiurazzi) to form the 'Fonderie Artisiche Riunite'. By 1929 the firm was under the management of Frederico and Salvatore Chiurazzi and know as 'Chiurazzi', or, officially, the 'Società Anonima: Fonderie, Cerimca, Marmoria'. Their catalogue of that year noted that the firm was formerly that of 'Chiurazzi and De Angelis'. In this catalogue the 'Vittoria' appears as no.93, and was available in four sizes of which one was the size of the original (40 cms.--as here, approximately; two of the others were larger) and in three patinas (Pompeian, Herculanean, and Renaissance, the first, which is used here, being closest to the original and also the cheapest, at 1,000 lire for this size, as against 1,250 for the black Herculanean and 1,500 for the brown Renaissance). The Roman bronze reproduced has the inventory number 4997 in the Naples Museum, and the modern number 576. It is regarded as a copy of a Hellenistic original and is not now included in the popular anthologies, although Chiurazzi's 1929 catalogue describes it as 'questa mirabile statua . . . rimarchevole per la leggerezza del drappo svolazzante al vento e che delinea la svelte forma del corpo'. As Chiurazzi acknowledged, the marble ball is a modern idea (found in the display of the bronze in the Naples Museum). The figure would originally have been suspended from the ring in its back. The bronze in the Naples Museum is also furnished with a wand in the figure's left hand but the figure would originally have held a palm or trophy. The other arm would, it is supposed, have held a trumpet to broadcast victory. A version of the Victory in the Glasgow Art gallery and Museum (93-28d) was purchased from Sabatino de Angelis et fils on 30 March 1893 for £8.

The simulated diaspro di Sicilia marble employed for the socle is of a type often employed by the firm of De Angelis/Chiurazzi (for which see No.5). The bronze is an accurate replica of a fragment of a statue found in the eighteenth century in the Villa dei Pisoni, Herculaneum i [[??]] Museo Nazionale, Naples, inv. no. 5618, modern number 605). It was long supposed, following a theory of Sogliani, to represent an ideal mingling of the type of Dionysus with the likeness of Plato and was known as the Dionysosplaton. Friedrichs considered it an original by Scopas or Praxiteles, but it is now regarded as a hellenistic modification (or sometimes as a Roman copy of a Hellenistic modification) of an earlier model. (A. and B. Maiuri, Das Nationalmeseum in Neapel (Munich, 1958), 66.) In Chiurazzi's 1929 catalogue this is no.4 [[??]] and priced at 2,400 lire for the original size (given as 50 cms. but the same as this version) in the 'Herculanean patina (black).

Lent by D.E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888, given later in the same year. S.24 in his catalogues. Bought by Fortnum from the sculptor and dealer Professor Emilio Santarelli of Florence in 1870 together with a bust of Lorenzo de' Medici. The socle is shown in Fortnum's photographs  and must have been fixed in Florence. A letter from Santarelli to Fortnum of 19 June 1870 discusses shipping from Livorno (undertaken through the agency of Luigi Stombert). The head had safely arrived on 26 July, followed by Santarelli's certificate, dated 16 August, in which he declared that he had acquired it 'circa venti anni fa'--i.e. in about 1850--from Professore Bibliotecario Ajazzi who had, he understood, long owned it. It was 'formerly in the Laurentian Library whence it had been abstracted many years ago'. In his notebook catalogue Fortum recorded that Santarelli would not for a long while agree to part with this head and the bust of Lorenzo. He paid £40 for the latter: this is likely to have cost the same amount.

Emilio Santarelli, who sold this terracotta to Fortnum, had acquired from Ajazzi as a portrait of Cellini. Santarell also believed it to be by Cellini. Santarelli was one of the leading sculptors in Florence and also a noted connoisseur (for other dealings between him and Fortnum see the Preliminary Essay). His most famous work was the full-length portrait of Michelangelo completed in 1856 for the Arcade of the Uffizi and he was much concerned with the iconography of famous Florentines of the Renaissance and incurably optimistic about the portraits of them. Fortnum was at least convinced that it was by Cellini, although the possibility of it being by Naninelli had occurred to him. It is 'beyond Baccio Bandinelli, & the rest, and by M. angelo [sic] it certainly is not', he wrote in the notebook catalogue. The attribution is defended at greater length in his large catalogue: 'the vigorous expression, the quiver of the lip, and the admirable treatment of the beard are remarkable. I don not know any other sculptor of the period of its unquestionable production with whose manner it so much agrees. It seems to me too good for B. Bandinelli.' The handling he compared with that in Cellini's bust portrait of Bindo Altoviti (Isabella Steward Gardener Museum, Boston) and the statue of Perseus in the Loggia dei Lanzi--both of them bronzes, and indeed no comparable work in clay by Cellini--or by Bandinelli--seems to have survived. Fortnum noted that Cellini was said to have modelled a bust of Annibale Caro 'to the medals of whom this bears some resemblance'. eF. Bell, however, annotating the large catalogue, noted that this possibility was ruled out by comparison with Dosio's memorial bust of Caro in S. Lorenzo in Damaso in Rome. Bell also 'inclined' to think that it was by Bandinelli, to whom it seems first to have been attributed by E. Plon (Benvenuto Cellini, orfèvre, médailleur, sculpteur (Paris,1883), 341). The modern literature on Cellini, most recently the monograph by Pope-Hennessy of 1986, does not discuss the terracotta. Maria Grazia Ciardi Dupré in 1963 published the head as by Rustici ('Giovan Francesco Rustici', Paragone, 14 (1963), 45-6), but without giving compelling reasons. Charles Avery in a letter to Ian Lowe of 9 March 1967 speculated that there might be a connection with a marble bust of Andrea Doria recently acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum and attributed to Montorsoli.

One can see why Fortnum preferred to give this head to Cellini rather than to Bandinelli: he was right to liken it to the bust of Bindo Altoviti (the vigorous treatment of the beard is especially close) and it has the fire of Cellini's bronze portrait of Cosimo and none of the blandness of Bandinelli's marble portrait of the same sitter. On the other hand, the head certainly resembles those in the engraved portraits of Bandinelli and in his own self-portraits (most notably as Nicodemus in the Pietà which marks his own tomb in SS Annunziata in Florence, in the profile relief in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence, and in the painting in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston). There is a still closer relationship with some drawings by Bandinelli of amply bearded, frowning men, usually regarded as somewhat idealized self-portraits, and perhaps intended as such, of which one notable example is in the British Museum (1895-9-15-555), and another was recently with La Sirène, of 14 rue de L'Eschaudé, Paris (no. 41 in their catalogue of Estampes et dessins anciens (1987) I). But both of these have rounded and softer modelling, typical of Bandinelli's drawings in chalk (and his marble reliefs), which is particularly evident in the hair, which flows forward in ornamental curls, whereas in the terracotta it is roughly clawed back and stabbed.

This need not discourage us from an attribution to Bandinelli, however, for whom working in clay may well have been analogous to drawing with a quill or reed, in which medium his work has a similar jagged energy. Furthermore, there is one marble sculpture by Bandinelli which is so similar to this terracotta that the two works must be closely related: the head of the saint in the niche to the left of Pope Leo X in the latter's tomb of 1536-41 in S. Maria sopra Minerva, Rome--a saint intended for St Paul but consistently misidentified (see R. Ward, Baccio Bandinelli (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, May-July 1988), 58-9). If the terracotta is what it seems--a large preparatory sketch for the marble (or even the fragment of a clay sketch for the marble salvaged and baked) then it is a very rare survival, without parallel in the sculpture of its period. The heads are difficult to compare (the marble can only be studied from below) but the differences are slight. In the marble the hair on the crown is more pronounced, the beard neater, the lips more pouted.

A sample was taken from the terracotta by Mrs Doreen Stoneham of the Oxford Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art in March 1987 and thermo-luminescence tests suggested a firing date between 1487 and 1637 (38l-z-88).",,

Mounted on a triangular base with three feet with a large threaded hole into which the tang fits (for the base see below).

Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888 and given later in the same year. B.412 in his catalogues. 'bt. Florence 1865.'

Fortnum regarded this as 'somewhat coarsely executed but with a distinctive character': the inept chiselling between the legs, the uncleaned junction of forearm and head, the hideous nipples, the botched modelling of the eyes (one smudged and the other crudely stabbed to suggest a pupil) deserve less qualified censure. He considered it as 'probably intended for Eve, the serpent fondling rather than wounding'. Cleopatra seems more likely, for although it is odd for that heroine to be represented completely undressed, the reptile is more the size of an asp than of the large serpent of the Garden of Eden. It also seems more inclined to bite than to whisper. The design of the triangular base with its feet in the form of abortive fat-headed dolphins and its weak frieze of floral arabesque and its execution--the dolphins and the field of the frieze given a punched texture--are typical of the workshop of Severo da Ravenna and no doubt suggested to Fortnum the idea that it was north Italian of the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. Bode, however, recognized that the bronze was a copy of a statuette by Bandinelli (Italian Bronze Statuettes Of the Renaissance (London, 1907-2), ii.18), and perhaps for this reason the base began to look wrong. Bell's pencil annotation to Fortnum's large catalogue reads, 'This misleading addition was removed and replaced by a marble plinth 1929' (old photographs show it mounted on a block of porto venere, gold-veined black marble). By the 1970s, however, it had become possible to identify the products of Severo da Ravenna's workshop and to see that the workshop continued in business under the management of Severo's son into the second half of the sixteenth century using, for the most part, models dating from about 1500. It was quite able to take over a model from Bandinelli. Consequently Anthony Radcliffe pointed out in a letter of 6 September 1976 to Christopher Lloyd that the triangular base was probably original. The base was found by November 1976 and was restored in March 1977. Examination of the bronze and 'X-rays' made from it for Radcliffe and Richard Stone of the Metropolitan museum, New York, confirmed that the technique of the bronze was entirely consistent with Severo's foundry style.

Other versions of the bronze are recorded. One from the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples, was exhibited in 1961 (Italian Bronze Statuettes (Arts Council, Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1961), no. 106). Another is in the Abbott Guggenheim Collection and was exhibited at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (L. Camins, Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes from the Abbott Guggenheim Collection (Sas Francisco, 1988), 20, no. 3). Three casts of the figure, even more coarsely finished and clumsily modelled, with serpents in different positions and the women given idiotic smiles, combine to form the Second lowest set of supporters of supporters of a seven-stage, three-sided, candelabrum (5 1/2 feet high) in the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco (61.35), the other elements of which are all found in other standard productions of Severo da Ravenna's workshop (it looks indeed like a compilation designed to cope with a surplus of stock).

The bronze in the Museo Nazionale of the Bargello, Florence (no. 354), from which these versions derive is of superior finish and larger--32.2 cms. high (including, however, an integral bronze base about 1 cm. high). The subject has always been identified as Cleopatra and is one of a set of six bronzes identified as by Bandinelli since the sixteenth century, two of which (a Venus with a dove and Jason) also bear his name. Of these bronzes, three are larger than the Cleopatra (Jason 39.8 cms., Venus with a dove 37.8 ems., and a Leda 36.1 cms.), but two very close in size to it (a Venus 33.3 cms. and a Leda 31.5 cms.). Three engraved portraits of Bandinelli show him in the company of similar bronze statuettes, and one of these, showing him surrounded by students drawing them by candlelight, is inscribed by the engraver, Agostino Veneziano, as depicting Bandinelli's 'academia' in the 'luogo detto Belvedere' in 1531. According to Vasari's life (Opere, ed. G. Milanesi (Florence,1906), vi. 153), it was when he was working in the Vatican Belvedere that Bandinelli first made bronze statuettes. This was after 1529 when he had accompanied Pope Clement VII from Bologna to Rome and was making plans for the adornment of Castel Sant'Angelo. 'To pass the time and to experiment with casting technology he made numerous statuettes alte due terzi e tonde [""height two-thirds of a braccio and in the round""--a braccio being for him about 50 cms.] of Herculeses, Venuses, Apollinos, Ledas, and other figures of his invention [altre sue fantasie] and, having then cast in bronze by Maestro Jacopo della Barba of Florence, they came out superbly.' Vasari notes that he presented these 'to His Holiness and to molti signori and some of them are now in Duke Cosimo's scrittorio, among over a hundred antique pieces, all rarities, and other modern ones'. The Bargello's bronzes have a Medici provenance. They may derive from models made in about 1530, but Heikamp has shown that the Cleopatra was made in 1544, that the Hercules was first recorded in 1549, and that the group of six was recorded for the first time in detail in an inventory of 1553. Chiarini notes that a document of 1550 reveals that three bronze figures by Bandinelli belonging to Cosimo I were then in the shop of the goldsmiths Domenico and Paolo Poggini who may therefore have been responsible for casting them.

Each scale-shaped piece of stone is outlined in black Belgian marble. The border design is framed in white Carrara marble. The coloured stones include imperial porphyry, granites, serpentines, alabasters, and semi-precious stones as well as marbles. Many are reworked from fragments of ancient Roman architecture (for example, the very distinctive bianco e nero antico, with its jagged pattern of black and white, the Pyrenean quarries of which were only rediscovered in the late nineteenth century), easily available in Rome. Others (most notably the brilliant green malachite from Siberia used for the smallest scales) were imported. The slab is supported by a tripod table veneered in coromandel with dull gilt metal mounts (perhaps not bronze, certainly not fire-gilt).

Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. F.27 in his catalogues. The table top was probably bought in Rome in 1852 (see below).

Table tops composed of numerous types of polished stone--and especially reusing the stones the ancient Romans had so esteemed--were perhaps first produced in Italy in the late fifteenth century. A splendid one was made for Isabella d'Este in 1499 out of a great variety of stones including serpentine and porphyry, and others the names of which were unknown (C. M. Brown, ' ""Lo insaciabile desiderio nostro de cose antique"": New Documents for Isabella d'Este's Collection of Antiquities', in C. H. Clough (ed.), Cultural Aspects of the Renaissance: Essays in Honour Of Paul Oskar Kristeller (Manchester, 1976), 349 n. 53). However, I know of no surviving table tops in which a wide variety of stones are displayed in a geometric pattern designed as much for geological instruction as for ornament, which were made before the second half of the eighteenth century. They seem to have been a speciality of Roman craftsmen. One such litoteca[a] with a curvaceous shape and short ormolu paw feet which folds open like a games board was presented in 1763 by Cardinal Riminaldi to his native Ferrara (Il Museo Civico in Ferrara: Donazioni e restauri, ii: Chiesa di San Romano  (Ferrara, 1985), 139-40). A painting by Laurent Pécheux of 1777 shows the Marchesa Boccapaduli in her museum unveiling a monstrance full of butterflies which is supported on an altar, as it were, of marble specimens (reproduced as colour plate XVII in A. González-Palacios, Il tempio del gusto (Roma e il regno delle Due Sicílie), 2 vols. (Milan, 1984) I). The tops were at first rectangular and intended for pier tables in grand apartments. Lalande in the first edition of his Voyage en Italie (Yverdon, 1764, v. 224) mentions such rectangular table tops as a novelty. Francesco (III) of Lorrain, husband of Maria Teresa of Austria, is depicted with such a table in a portrait by Franz Messmer and Ludwig Kohl dated 1773 (eight years after the emperor's death) which is in the Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna, and a very similar table is in the Pitti Palace, Florence (A. González-Palacios, Il tempio del gusto (La Toscana e l'Italia settentionale), 2 vols. (Milan, 1986), i. 144, ii. 299-300). By 1787 when Lalande's second edition appeared (v. 71) they were clearly a well-established fashion. A parallel fashion may be observed in gold boxes including specimens of hardstones which were a speciality of Dresden workshops in the last quarter of the eighteenth century.

An early British reference to table tops of this sort comes in the sale of the stock-in-trade of Thomas Carter in 1777 when a pair of 'inlaid studios of marble' were sold for 20 guineas (Department of Prints and Drawings, British Museum, A-5-9, pp. 54-60). In the same year Henry Blundell bought a specimen table from a marble dealer in the 'Campo Vacino' (sic) and was also presented with one by Pope Pius VI ([H. Blundell], Account of the Statues, Busts, Bass-Relieves, Cinerary Urns, and Other Ancient Marbles, and Paintings, at Ince, collected by H.B. (Liverpool,1803)). The majority acquired in the late eighteenth century arc likely to have been purchased by gentlemen on the Grand Tour who had throughout the century imported slabs of ancient marble from Rome (as well as pietra dura inlay from Florence) for table tops.

Circular specimen marble table tops appear to have been the nineteenth-century fashion in Britain. Christopher Gilbert (in 'A Specimen Marble Table', Connoisseur (Oct. 1973), 78-81) notes that circular tables with marble, scagliola, mosaic, or marble inlay tops were known as Dejune tables, and were described in George Smith's Designs for Household Furniture of 1808 and in the second edition of his Cabinet-Makers's and Upholsterer's Guide of 1826 as suitable for 'ladies Boudoirs or Morning Breakfast Rooms' and for 'the boudoir or drawing rooms'. The circular form when large, however, may always have been intended for libraries or galleries. Large or small, they are characteristic of the tendency, increasing steadily in the early nineteenth century, for furniture to be designed for the centre of a room. It was the circular shape which stimulated more complex patterns in place of the chequerboard.

Two other table tops of the same size and pattern as that in the Ashmolean Museum have come to my attention. One with a massive rosewood support of about 1850 (combining heavy baroque scrolls with Gothic trefoils and Gothic foliage) was lot 146 at Christie's, London, 7 May 1987. Another, supported by three gilt sphinxes in the Empire style which, if original, would date from the first two decades of the nineteenth century and would probably have been made in France, was illustrated in the Connoisseur for July 1965 (p.153). In all cases the central feature is a 'micro-mosaic' reproduction of the famous ancient mosaic found in Hadrian's Villa, and preserved in the Capitoline Museum since 1765, representing three doves drinking from a brazen vessel in which they are partially reflected. In all cases the first and smallest scales are of malachite. There are variations in the colours--for example the largest Scales arc all outlined in black against porphyry in the Ashmolean table top but against giallo antico in the one at Christie's in 1987. The support of the Ashmolean table top with its lion's paw feet and its lion masks at the braced Centres of its three tense scroll supports is an example of early nineteenth-century British furniture at its most bold. It could have been made as early as 1815 or as late as 1855.

One Roman workshop known to have made such work is that of Giacomo Raffaelli (1753-1836). The smaller inlaid table top published in 1973 by Christophcr Gilbert (op. cit.)--3 feet in diameter--is of similar character. The inlaid marble is arranged in a radial pattern forming a star with twenty-four outer points, each 'scale', however, being sharper and the black borders being legible as continuous lines. It is similar also in its use of malachite. A plan and description of this table survives which commences with the information that it was purchased on 8 March 1831 'from the very illustrious Signor Erskine in the establishment of Councillor Giacomo Raffaelli Via del Babuino No. 92--near the Albert Theatre in Rome'. Raffaelli was councillor to the Imperial Russian Court for which he did much work (which explains the use of malachite).

Fortnum also owned two smaller tables of this type. One, which he bequeathed to E. Maude Thompson (F. 28 in his catalogue), had a top of 'Florentine mosaic' with a spray of flowers in pietra dura. He bought it in 1852 in Florence and noted that it was the work of 'Cav. Bianchini' of that city. He had it mounted in London on an elaborate tripod support involving terms of Hercules. Another (F. 29), mounted in a similar manner and regarded as a companion, was of 'Roman mosaic'. It featured a central medallion of 'Cupid in the act of' discharging an arrow from his bow' and was made by 'Cav. Barberi' of Rome. This latter table, also acquired in

1852' he bequeathed to Lord Halsbury. In his large catalogue Fortnum did not name the maker of the large table top in the Ashmolean, but in his notebook catalogue he cites this also as the work of Barberi. We may conjecture that it too was acquired in 1852 or possibly a little earlier or later, suggesting or suggested by his acquisition of the smaller example.

Michelangelo Barberi was the leading practitioner of the Roman art of micro-mosaic pictures in the mid-nineteenth century. Like Raffaelli he had many contacts with Russia. Indeed he was a protégé of the Princess Volkonski and helped establish the mosaic school of St Petersburg. Some of his most celebrated works--the Trionfo d'Amore of 1826, the Twenty Four Hours of Rome of 1839--are in the Hermitage. One might suppose that he only made the central circle of the table top, but there is evidence that mosaicists also supplied the larger marble inlay; indeed Giacomo Raffaelli was also chiefly known for his micro-mosaic although one could (as we have seen) buy table tops from him without any mosaic element. Fortnum could have known of Barberi's work without travelling to Rome for it was awarded a medal at the Great Exhibition in 1851. In 1856, when appointed Commendatore del Pontificio Ordine di S. Silvestro, Barberi published engravings of 'Alcuni Musaici usciti dallo Studio del Cav. Michel 'Angelo Barberi'. (M. Alfieri, M. G. Branchetti, D. Petochi, I mosaici minuti romani. (Rome, 1981), 46, 125-30). Two important round micromosaic tabletops, with views of major Italian cities in one case and of the flora and classical ruins of southern Italy in the other, are in the collection of Mr and Mrs Arthur Gilbert and on loan to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (M.77.L81 and L.88.22.3). The supports are of gilt bronze but otherwise similar to that of the Ashmolean table.

Of all the designs reproduced in Roman Micro-mosaic between 1770 and 1870 none exceeded in popularity Pliny's Doves (see Alfieri, Branchetti, and Petochi, op. cit., figs. 13 and 29 and the ten plates on 226-7).
